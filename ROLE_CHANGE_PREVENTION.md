# Role Change Prevention Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation to prevent users from changing their role after initial selection and profile saving in the Quickwork web application.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChooseRole Page (`src/pages/ChooseRole.tsx`)
- **Role Check on Load**: Added `useEffect` to check if user already has a role/profile
- **Redirect with Toast**: If user already has a role, shows informative toast message and redirects to appropriate profile page
- **Updated Footer Message**: Changed footer message from "Don't worry, you can always change your role later" to "Choose carefully - your role cannot be changed once your profile is saved"

### 2. Profile Headers Cleanup
- **EnhancedProfileHeader**: Removed "Change Role" button and confirmation dialog
- **ProfileHeader**: Removed "Change Role" button and confirmation dialog
- **Unused Imports**: Cleaned up unused imports (`useState`, `useNavigate`, `useAppDispatch`, `resetProfileState`)

### 3. User Experience Flow
1. **First Time Users**: Can select role on ChooseRole page
2. **Returning Users**: Automatically redirected to their profile page if they try to access ChooseRole again
3. **Profile Forms**: No role selection UI in profile forms (role is read-only once set)

## Implementation Details

### Role Check Logic
```typescript
// In ChooseRole.tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (currentProfile && currentProfile.role) {
    console.log('User already has a role:', currentProfile.role);
    toast('You have already chosen your role and cannot change it.', {
      icon: 'ℹ️',
      duration: 4000,
    });
    
    // Redirect to appropriate profile page or dashboard
    const redirectRoute = currentProfile.role === 'job_seeker' 
      ? '/profile/job-seeker' 
      : '/profile/employer';
    
    navigate(redirectRoute, { replace: true });
  }
}, [currentProfile, navigate]);
```

### Removed Functionality
- "Change Role" buttons from both ProfileHeader components
- Role change confirmation dialogs
- Navigation back to role selection from profile pages

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Protection
- ✅ Prevents UI access to role changing functionality
- ✅ Redirects users away from role selection if they already have a role
- ✅ Shows clear messaging about role immutability

### Backend Recommendation
While the frontend prevents role changes, it's recommended to also implement backend validation:
- Reject role change requests if user already has a saved profile
- Add role immutability checks in the profile update API endpoint
- Log attempts to change roles for security monitoring

## User Journey
1. **Registration** → **ChooseRole** → **Profile Form** → **Dashboard**
2. **Subsequent logins** → **Dashboard** (bypasses ChooseRole)
3. **Direct ChooseRole access** → **Redirect to Profile/Dashboard** (with toast message)

## Benefits
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental role changes that could corrupt profile data
- **User Experience**: Clear communication about role permanence
- **Business Logic**: Maintains consistent user categorization
- **Security**: Reduces potential for role manipulation attacks

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/ChooseRole.tsx` - Added role check and prevention logic
- `src/features/profile/components/EnhancedProfileHeader.tsx` - Removed Change Role functionality
- `src/features/profile/components/ProfileHeader.tsx` - Recreated without Change Role functionality

## Testing
- ✅ Build verification: `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Clean imports and unused code removal

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding admin functionality to change user roles (with proper authorization)
- Implement audit logging for role-related actions
- Add backend enforcement of role immutability rules
- Consider role change requests through support system if business requires it
