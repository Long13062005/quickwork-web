# Logout Implementation Update

## Overview

This document describes the updates made to align the frontend logout functionality with the backend implementation. The backend uses HttpOnly cookies for authentication, specifically a `refreshToken` that must be properly deleted during logout.

## Backend Logout Endpoint

```java
@PostMapping("/logout")
public ResponseEntity<?> logout(HttpServletResponse response) {
    Cookie cookie = new Cookie("refreshToken", null);
    cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
    cookie.setSecure(true);
    cookie.setPath("/");
    cookie.setMaxAge(0); // Delete cookie
    response.addCookie(cookie);
    System.out.println("Logout successful, refresh token cleared");
    return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
}
```

The backend logout endpoint:
1. Creates a new cookie named "refreshToken" with a null value
2. Sets the cookie as HttpOnly and Secure
3. Sets the path to "/"
4. Sets maxAge to 0 to delete the cookie
5. Returns a 200 OK response

## Frontend Implementation Updates

### 1. Auth Service Update

Updated the `authAPI.logout` method to:
- Call the exact backend endpoint `/logout` (removed `/auth` prefix)
- Maintain HTTP-only cookie authentication
- Handle error cases appropriately
- Provide informative logging

```typescript
logout: async () => {
  console.log('authAPI: Starting logout process...');
  const isSecure = window.location.protocol === 'https:';
  console.log('authAPI: Environment:', isSecure ? 'HTTPS (secure cookies)' : 'HTTP (non-secure)');
  
  try {
    console.log('authAPI: Calling backend logout endpoint...');
    // Call backend logout endpoint which sets refreshToken cookie to null with maxAge=0
    const response = await api.post('/logout');
    console.log('authAPI: Backend logout successful - refreshToken cookie cleared by server');
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('authAPI: Backend logout failed, clearing cookies manually:', error);
    // Even on error, proceed with local cookie cleanup
    clearAuthCookies();
    throw error;
  } finally {
    console.log('authAPI: Logout process completed');
  }
}
```

### 2. Dashboard Components Update

Updated the logout handlers in all dashboard components (Admin, User, Employer) to:
- Show loading toast during logout
- Handle errors properly with error toast notifications
- Maintain consistent behavior across all components

Example implementation:
```typescript
const handleLogout = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    toast.loading('Logging out...', { id: 'logout' });
    await logout();
    // Toast success message is not needed since navigation will occur
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error);
    toast.error('Logout failed. Please try again.', { id: 'logout' });
  }
}, [logout]);
```

## Logout Flow

1. User clicks logout button in any dashboard
2. Loading toast is displayed
3. Frontend calls `authAPI.logout()`
4. Backend `/logout` endpoint is called
5. Backend deletes the HttpOnly refreshToken cookie
6. On success/failure:
   - Success: AuthContext navigates to login page
   - Failure: Error toast is shown, and AuthContext still attempts navigation

## Security Considerations

- HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript, improving security against XSS attacks
- The backend is the source of truth for authentication status
- Cookie deletion is attempted both server-side and client-side for redundancy
- Secure flag is set for HTTPS environments

## Testing

The updated logout functionality has been tested across all user types:
- Administrator
- Job Seeker
- Employer

In all cases, the logout process successfully removes authentication cookies and redirects to the login page.

## Integration with Previous Fixes

This update builds on previous logout function fixes documented in LOGOUT_FUNCTION_FIX.md, with these additional improvements:

1. Updated the endpoint URL to match the exact backend API path
2. Enhanced error handling with user-friendly toast messages
3. Ensured consistent implementation across all dashboard types
4. Maintained full compatibility with HttpOnly cookie authentication
