# Professional Title Display Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of professional title display in the EnhancedProfileHeader component for both Job Seekers and Employers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ProfileHeader Display
- Added `getProfessionalTitle()` function to extract title based on user role
- Added professional title display below the user's name
- Styled with blue color to make it stand out as professional information

### 2. Role-Based Title Sources
- **Job Seekers**: Title comes from `profile.jobSeekerData.title`
- **Employers**: Title comes from `profile.employerData.title`

### 3. Visual Design
- Title displays in blue color (`text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400`)
- Medium font weight to distinguish from name but keep it prominent
- Positioned between name and contact information

## Implementation Details

### Title Extraction Function
```typescript
const getProfessionalTitle = () => {
  if (isJobSeeker) {
    return profile.jobSeekerData?.title || '';
  } else if (isEmployer) {
    const employerProfile = profile as EmployerProfile;
    return employerProfile.employerData?.title || '';
  }
  return '';
};
```

### Title Display in UI
```tsx
{/* Professional Title */}
{getProfessionalTitle() && (
  <p className="text-xl text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 font-medium mb-2">
    {getProfessionalTitle()}
  </p>
)}
```

## Profile Data Structure

### Job Seeker Title
- **Location**: `profile.jobSeekerData.title`
- **Examples**: "Software Developer", "UI/UX Designer", "Data Scientist"
- **Form Field**: Available in job seeker profile form

### Employer Title
- **Location**: `profile.employerData.title`
- **Examples**: "HR Manager", "CEO", "Recruiting Director", "Technical Lead"
- **Form Field**: Available in employer profile form

## User Experience Flow

1. **Role Selection**: User selects Job Seeker or Employer role
2. **Profile Creation**: `title` field is initialized as empty string
3. **Profile Form**: User fills in their professional title
4. **Profile Display**: Title appears prominently in profile header
5. **Dashboard**: Title is visible across all profile views

## Benefits

### Professional Identity
- Clear display of user's professional role
- Enhanced profile presentation
- Better context for profile viewers

### Visual Hierarchy
- Name (largest, bold)
- Professional Title (medium, blue)
- Contact Info (smaller, gray)
- Bio (paragraph text)

### Consistency
- Same display logic for both user types
- Consistent styling across light/dark themes
- Responsive design considerations

## Technical Implementation

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- Safe property access with optional chaining
- Role-based type assertions where needed

### Conditional Display
- Only shows title if it exists (not empty)
- Graceful handling of undefined/null values
- No layout shift when title is missing

### Accessibility
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Screen reader friendly
- Focus management considerations

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
- Edit title inline functionality
- Title validation and suggestions
- Professional title verification
- Industry-specific title recommendations

### Integration Opportunities
- Connect with LinkedIn API for title suggestions
- Industry classification based on title
- Job matching algorithms using title data
- Professional networking features

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/ChooseRole.tsx` - Added title to initial profile data
- `src/features/profile/types/profile.types.ts` - Added title to interfaces
- `src/features/profile/ProfileSlice.ts` - Added title to profile creation
- `src/features/profile/components/EmployerProfile.tsx` - Added title to form data
- `src/features/profile/components/EnhancedProfileHeader.tsx` - Added title display

## Testing
- ✅ Build verification successful
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
- ✅ Proper conditional rendering
- ✅ Dark/light theme compatibility

The professional title is now prominently displayed in the profile header, providing clear professional identity for both Job Seekers and Employers.
