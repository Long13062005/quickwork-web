**Access**: Job seekers with completed profiles

**Features**:
- **Statistics Cards**: Profile views, applications sent, interviews scheduled, profile completion percentage
- **Job Recommendations**: Personalized job matches with compatibility scores
- **Recent Applications**: Track application status (pending, reviewing, interview, etc.)

- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with smooth animations

**Key Components**:

## Routing Updates

### Updated Files
1. **`src/App.tsx`**:
   - Added lazy loading for dashboard components
   - Created protected routes for both dashboards
   - Dashboards require authentication AND completed profile

2. **`src/components/SmartRedirect.tsx`**:
   - Enhanced logic to check profile completion
   - Redirects completed profiles to appropriate dashboard
   - Incomplete profiles still go to profile setup

3. **`src/pages/ProfileSuccess.tsx`**:
   - Updated "Go to Dashboard" button to route correctly based on user role
   - Job seekers → `/dashboard`
   - Employers → `/employer/dashboard`

## Route Structure

```
Authentication Flow:
/ → SmartRedirect
  ├── Not Authenticated → /auth
  ├── No Profile/Role → /auth/choose-role
  ├── Incomplete Profile → /profile/{role}
  └── Complete Profile → /{role}/dashboard

Dashboard Routes:
├── /dashboard (Job Seekers)
└── /employer/dashboard (Employers)

Profile Routes:
├── /profile/job-seeker
├── /profile/employer
└── /profile/success
```
