# Profile Logout Enhancement

## Overview
Added logout functionality to the EnhancedProfileHeader component to provide users with a convenient way to log out directly from their profile page.

## Changes Made

### EnhancedProfileHeader.tsx
- **Added imports**: Added `useContext`, `useCallback` from React, `toast` from react-hot-toast, and `AuthContext`
- **Added logout handler**: Created `handleLogout` function that:
  - Shows loading toast during logout process
  - Calls the `logout` function from AuthContext
  - Shows success toast on successful logout
  - Shows error toast and logs error on failure
- **Added logout button**: Added red-styled logout button with:
  - Door emoji icon (ðŸšª)
  - Red color scheme to indicate logout action
  - Proper accessibility attributes (aria-label, title)
  - Consistent styling with other action buttons
  - Hover and focus states for better UX

### Button Positioning
The logout button is positioned:
- After the Theme Toggle
- Before the Submit Profile button (if present)
- Before the Export button (if present)
- Before the Edit Profile button

## User Experience
- **Visual clarity**: Red color scheme clearly indicates logout action
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and titles for screen readers
- **Toast notifications**: Users get immediate feedback during logout process
- **Consistent styling**: Follows the same design pattern as other buttons in the header
- **Error handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Technical Implementation
- Uses React hooks (`useContext`, `useCallback`) for state management
- Integrates with existing AuthContext for logout functionality
- Uses react-hot-toast for user notifications
- Maintains existing button styling patterns and responsive design
- Follows accessibility best practices

## Testing
- âœ… Project builds successfully
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… All existing functionality preserved
- âœ… Logout button appears in profile header
- âœ… Maintains responsive design

## Future Considerations
- Could add confirmation dialog for logout action
- Could add keyboard shortcuts for logout
- Could add logout analytics tracking
- Could add "are you sure?" prompt for unsaved profile changes

## Files Modified
- `src/features/profile/components/EnhancedProfileHeader.tsx`
  - Added logout functionality
  - Added logout button with proper styling and accessibility
  - Integrated with AuthContext for logout action
  - Added toast notifications for user feedback
