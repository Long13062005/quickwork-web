# Dashboard Module Updates

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Integration with HTTPOnly Cookie Authentication

The Job Seeker and Employer dashboard modules have been updated to fully integrate with the new HTTPOnly cookie authentication system and the unified profile API.

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### 1. User Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Re-integrated with `useProfile` hook to fetch authenticated user profile
- Displays user name and role from profile data
- Added loading state during profile fetch
- Maintains HTTP-only cookie authentication for API calls
- Shows personalized dashboard with job recommendations and stats

### 2. Employer Dashboard (`/employer/dashboard`) 
- Re-integrated with `useProfile` hook to fetch employer profile
- Shows company name from profile data
- Added loading state during profile fetch
- Displays employer role information in header
- Maintains HTTP-only cookie authentication for API calls

### 3. Protected Routes
- Both dashboards are protected with authentication and profile checks
- Users are redirected to login if not authenticated
- Profile completeness is verified before dashboard access

## 📝 Usage Notes

### Job Seeker Dashboard
```typescript
// Dashboard uses useProfile hook to access current user profile
const { currentProfile, loading, fetchMyProfile } = useProfile();

// Fetch profile when dashboard loads
useEffect(() => {
  fetchMyProfile();
  loadDashboardData();
}, [fetchMyProfile]);

// Display personalized greeting using profile data
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
  Welcome back, {currentProfile?.firstName ? `${currentProfile.firstName} ${currentProfile.lastName}` : 'User'}!
</h1>
```

### Employer Dashboard
```typescript
// Dashboard uses useProfile hook to access employer profile
const { currentProfile, loading, fetchMyProfile } = useProfile();

// Fetch profile when dashboard loads
useEffect(() => {
  fetchMyProfile();
  loadDashboardData();
}, [fetchMyProfile]);

// Display company name from profile
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
  {companyName} Dashboard
</h1>

// Helper function to get company name
const getCompanyName = () => {
  if (currentProfile?.role === 'employer') {
    return currentProfile.companyName || 'Your Company';
  }
  return 'Your Company';
};
```
