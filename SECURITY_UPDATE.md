# Profile API Security Update

## Changes Made

The Profile API service has been updated to use secure HTTPS-only cookies for authentication instead of localStorage tokens.

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed localStorage dependency**: No longer reads access tokens from localStorage
2. **Added secure cookie support**: All requests now use `credentials: 'include'`
3. **Updated all API methods**: Every profile API call now properly includes cookies
4. **File upload security**: XMLHttpRequest uploads now use `withCredentials: true`

### Security Benefits:

- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Prevents XSS attacks by making tokens inaccessible to JavaScript
- **Secure Flag**: Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS
- **SameSite Protection**: Helps prevent CSRF attacks
- **Automatic Cookie Management**: Browser handles cookie lifecycle

### Server-Side Requirements:

To fully implement secure cookie authentication, your backend should:

1. **Set secure cookie options**:
   ```javascript
   res.cookie('accessToken', token, {
     httpOnly: true,      // Prevents XSS
     secure: true,        // HTTPS only
     sameSite: 'strict',  // CSRF protection
     maxAge: 15 * 60 * 1000 // 15 minutes
   });
   ```

2. **Configure CORS properly**:
   ```javascript
   app.use(cors({
     origin: 'https://your-frontend-domain.com',
     credentials: true  // Allow cookies
   }));
   ```

3. **Validate cookies on protected routes**:
   ```javascript
   const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
     const token = req.cookies.accessToken;
     // Validate token...
   };
   ```

### Frontend Integration:

The existing API service (`src/services/api.tsx`) is already configured correctly with:
```javascript
withCredentials: true
```

This ensures all axios requests automatically include cookies.

### Migration Notes:

- Remove any localStorage token management from auth flows
- Update login/logout handlers to rely on cookie-based auth
- Test all authenticated endpoints to ensure cookies are being sent
- Verify CORS configuration allows credentials

### Development Environment:

For local development, ensure:
- Use HTTPS (even for localhost) 
- Set `secure: false` for development cookies only
- Configure proper domain settings for cookies
