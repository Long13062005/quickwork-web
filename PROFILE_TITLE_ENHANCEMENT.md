# Profile Title Field Enhancement

## Overview
Added `title` field to profile data structures to capture professional titles for both Job Seekers and Employers.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChooseRole Page (`src/pages/ChooseRole.tsx`)
Updated the initial `profileData` object to include a `title` field:

```typescript
const profileData = {
  firstName: user?.fullName?.split(' ')[0] || '',
  lastName: user?.fullName?.split(' ').slice(1).join(' ') || '',
  email: user?.email || '',
  title: '', // Professional title - to be filled in profile form
  bio: '',
  location: {
    city: '',
    state: '',
    country: '',
    timezone: 'UTC'
  }
};
```

### 2. Profile Types (`src/features/profile/types/profile.types.ts`)

#### Updated EmployerProfileFormData
Added `title` field to capture the employer's job title/position:

```typescript
export interface EmployerProfileFormData {
  // Basic Info
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  title: string; // Job title/position in the company
  // ... rest of the fields
}
```

#### Updated EmployerProfile Interface
Added `title` to the `employerData` object:

```typescript
export interface EmployerProfile extends BaseProfile {
  role: 'employer';
  employerData: {
    title: string; // Job title/position of the person in the company
    companyName: string;
    // ... rest of the fields
  };
}
```

### 3. ProfileSlice (`src/features/profile/ProfileSlice.ts`)
Updated the `createLocalProfile` function to include the title field:

```typescript
employerData: {
  title: profileData.title || '', // Job title/position in the company
  companyName: '',
  // ... rest of the fields
}
```

### 4. EmployerProfile Component (`src/features/profile/components/EmployerProfile.tsx`)
Updated the form data conversion to include the title field:

```typescript
const formData: EmployerProfileFormData = {
  firstName: updatedProfile.firstName,
  lastName: updatedProfile.lastName,
  email: user?.email || updatedProfile.email || '',
  phone: updatedProfile.phone || '',
  title: updatedProfile.employerData?.title || '', // Job title/position
  // ... rest of the fields
};
```

## Field Usage

### Job Seekers
- **Existing**: `jobSeekerData.title` - Professional title (e.g., "Software Developer", "UI/UX Designer")
- Already existed in the type system

### Employers
- **New**: `employerData.title` - Job title/position in the company (e.g., "HR Manager", "CEO", "Recruiting Director")
- This represents the employer's role within their organization

## Benefits

### 1. **Professional Identity**
- Job seekers can specify their professional title
- Employers can indicate their position/role in the company

### 2. **Better Matching**
- Helps in understanding the context of the person's role
- Useful for networking and professional connections

### 3. **Profile Completeness**
- Adds another important field to profile completion calculations
- Enhances the professional appearance of profiles

### 4. **Consistency**
- Both user types now have title fields in their respective data structures
- Maintains type safety across the application

## Type Safety
- ✅ All TypeScript interfaces updated
- ✅ Form data types include the new field
- ✅ Profile creation logic handles the title field
- ✅ Component prop types are consistent
- ✅ Build verification successful

## Usage Examples

### Job Seeker Title
```typescript
jobSeekerData: {
  title: "Senior Frontend Developer"
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Employer Title
```typescript
employerData: {
  title: "Talent Acquisition Manager",
  companyName: "TechCorp Inc.",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- Display titles prominently in profile headers
- Use titles for role-based matching algorithms
- Add title history/career progression tracking
