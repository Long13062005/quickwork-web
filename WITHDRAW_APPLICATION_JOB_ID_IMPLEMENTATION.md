# Withdraw Application by Job ID Implementation

## Summary
Updated the withdraw application functionality to use the new backend endpoint that accepts job ID instead of application ID.

## Backend Endpoint
```java
@PutMapping("/withdraw/job/{jobId}")
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
public ResponseEntity<?> withdrawApplicationByJobId(@PathVariable Long jobId) {
    try {
        ApplicationEntity withdrawnApplication = applicationService.withdrawApplicationByJobId(jobId);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(withdrawnApplication);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

## Frontend Changes Made

### 1. Updated Service Layer (`src/services/application.ts`)

#### Added New Endpoint:
```typescript
const APPLICATION_ENDPOINTS = {
  // ... existing endpoints
  WITHDRAW_BY_JOB_ID: (jobId: number) => `/applications/withdraw/job/${jobId}`,
  // ... other endpoints
} as const;
```

#### Updated withdrawApplication Method:
```typescript
/**
 * Withdraw application by job ID (requires USER role)
 */
static async withdrawApplication(jobId: number): Promise<ApplicationEntity> {
  const response = await api.put<ApplicationEntity>(
    APPLICATION_ENDPOINTS.WITHDRAW_BY_JOB_ID(jobId),
    {},
    {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      withCredentials: true
    }
  );
  return response.data;
}
```

### 2. Updated Redux Slice (`src/features/application/applicationSlice.ts`)

#### Updated Async Thunk:
```typescript
export const withdrawApplication = createAsyncThunk(
  'jobApplication/withdrawApplication',
  async (jobId: number) => {
    const response = await jobApplicationAPI.withdrawApplication(jobId);
    return response;
  }
);
```

### 3. Updated Component (`src/pages/MyApplications.tsx`)

#### Updated Handler Function:
```typescript
const handleWithdrawApplication = async (applicationId: number) => {
  try {
    // Find the application to get its jobId
    const application = myApplications.find(app => app.id === applicationId);
    if (!application) {
      console.error('Application not found');
      return;
    }
    
    await dispatch(withdrawApplication(application.jobId)).unwrap();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to withdraw application:', error);
  }
};
```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Endpoint Change**: 
   - From: `/applications/{applicationId}/status` with `WITHDRAWN` status
   - To: `/applications/withdraw/job/{jobId}` with empty body

2. **Parameter Change**: 
   - From: Application ID
   - To: Job ID

3. **Component Logic**: 
   - ApplicationCard still passes application ID to the handler
   - MyApplications handler now finds the application by ID and extracts jobId
   - Redux thunk now accepts jobId parameter

4. **HTTP Method**: 
   - Still uses PUT method
   - Empty request body instead of status string

## Benefits

1. **Backend Consistency**: Aligns with the specific backend endpoint for withdrawal
2. **Cleaner API**: Dedicated endpoint for withdrawal operations
3. **Maintained UX**: ApplicationCard component doesn't need to change
4. **Type Safety**: All TypeScript types remain consistent

## Testing Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ No runtime errors in development
- ✅ HTTPOnly cookies properly configured

## Error Handling

The implementation includes proper error handling:
- Application not found in local state
- Network errors from API calls
- Backend validation errors

## Next Steps

1. Test the withdraw functionality in the browser
2. Verify the correct job ID is being sent to the backend
3. Confirm the application status is updated correctly in the UI
4. Test error scenarios (invalid job ID, network failures)

The implementation is now fully aligned with the backend API and ready for testing.
