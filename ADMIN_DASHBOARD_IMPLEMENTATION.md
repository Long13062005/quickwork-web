# Admin Dashboard Implementation

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Admin Dashboard and Role-Based Navigation

The Quickwork platform now features a dedicated admin dashboard with specialized administrative tools and functionality. The SmartRedirect component has been enhanced to properly route users to the appropriate dashboard based on their profile type.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 1. Admin Dashboard Component
- Created a comprehensive admin dashboard UI (`/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- Implemented key admin features:
  - User management with table view and status indicators
  - System statistics and health monitoring
  - Quick action panel for common administrative tasks
  - Role management interface

### 2. Enhanced Routing
- Added protected route for admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`
- Updated SmartRedirect to dynamically route to the correct dashboard based on profile type:
  - Job Seekers → `/dashboard`
  - Employers → `/employer/dashboard` 
  - Admins → `/admin/dashboard`

### 3. SmartRedirect Enhancement
```typescript
// Determine the correct dashboard based on profile type
const getDashboardUrl = async () => {
  try {
    const profileResponse = await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:1010/api'}/profile/me`, {
      credentials: 'include',
    });
    
    if (profileResponse.ok) {
      const profileData = await profileResponse.json();
      
      // Check profile type to determine correct dashboard
      if (profileData.profileType === 'EMPLOYER') {
        return '/employer/dashboard';
      } else if (profileData.profileType === 'ADMIN') {
        return '/admin/dashboard';
      }
    }
    
    // Default for job seekers or if can't determine
    return '/dashboard';
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('SmartRedirect: Error determining dashboard:', error);
    return '/dashboard'; // Default to job seeker dashboard on error
  }
};
```
