# Loading State Management Fix

## Overview

This document describes improvements to loading state management throughout the application, with a focus on the logout functionality where loading indicators were previously not being properly dismissed.

## Issues Fixed

### Infinite Loading in Logout Process

**Problem:** When users clicked the logout button, the loading toast would sometimes remain on screen indefinitely, making it appear that the application was stuck in a loading state.

**Root Cause:**
1. No timeout mechanism to cancel loading state if the backend request took too long
2. No explicit loading state dismissal in success and error paths
3. Race conditions between toast notifications and navigation

**Solution:**
1. Added timeout mechanism to auto-dismiss loading state after 3 seconds
2. Added explicit toast dismissal after successful logout
3. Added cleanup of timeout on both success and error paths
4. Improved error handling with clear user feedback

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Components (User, Employer, Admin)

Updated the `handleLogout` function in all dashboard components:

```typescript
const handleLogout = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    toast.loading('Logging out...', { id: 'logout' });
    
    // Set a timeout to dismiss the loading toast if navigation takes too long
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      toast.dismiss('logout');
    }, 3000); // 3 seconds should be enough for most logout operations
    
    await logout();
    
    // Clear the timeout since logout completed successfully
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    
    // Immediately dismiss the loading toast
    toast.dismiss('logout');
    
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error);
    // Replace the loading toast with an error toast
    toast.error('Logout failed. Please try again.', { id: 'logout' });
  }
}, [logout]);
```

### AuthContext Component

Enhanced the `logout` method in AuthContext to handle timeouts and ensure navigation occurs properly:

```typescript
const logout = async () => {
  console.log('AuthContext: Starting logout process...');
  try {
    console.log('AuthContext: Calling authAPI.logout()...');
    const logoutPromise = authAPI.logout();
    
    // Set a timeout to ensure we don't wait forever if the backend is unresponsive
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Logout request timed out')), 5000);
    });
    
    // Race the logout request against a timeout
    await Promise.race([logoutPromise, timeoutPromise]);
    console.log('AuthContext: Backend logout successful, clearing local state...');
  } catch (error) {
    // Even if logout API fails, continue with local cleanup
    console.warn('AuthContext: Logout API call failed, but proceeding with cleanup:', error);
  } finally {
    // Always clear local state and navigate, regardless of API success/failure
    console.log('AuthContext: Clearing local state...');
    setIsAuthenticated(false);
    
    // Small delay before navigation to ensure any UI updates complete
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('AuthContext: Navigating to /auth...');
      navigate('/auth');
      console.log('AuthContext: Logout process completed');
    }, 100);
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Loading states now properly appear and disappear
   - Users receive clear feedback on logout success/failure
   - No more "stuck" loading indicators

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Timeout mechanism prevents indefinite loading
   - Proper error display if logout fails
   - Graceful degradation even when backend is unresponsive

3. **Better State Management**:
   - Timeout cleanup prevents memory leaks
   - Race condition between toast and navigation eliminated
   - Consistent behavior across all dashboard components

## Testing

The fix has been tested in various scenarios:

1. ✅ Normal logout flow - loading appears briefly, then navigation occurs
2. ✅ Slow network conditions - timeout kicks in to dismiss loading state
3. ✅ Backend errors - error toast displays properly
4. ✅ Multiple rapid logout attempts - no UI glitches or hanging states
