# HTTPOnly Cookie Authentication Update

## Overview
Updated the application to use HTTPOnly cookies for JWT authentication instead of localStorage tokens, improving security by preventing XSS attacks from accessing authentication tokens.

## Changes Made

### 1. JobDetail Component (`src/pages/JobDetail.tsx`)
- **Updated `handleSimpleApply` function**: Removed Authorization header with Bearer token
- **Added `credentials: 'include'`**: Ensures HTTPOnly cookies are sent with requests
- **Simplified authentication**: Browser automatically handles HTTPOnly cookies

```typescript
// Before: Using localStorage token
const response = await fetch(`/api/applications/apply/${currentJob.id}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`
  },
  credentials: 'include'
});

// After: Using HTTPOnly cookies
const response = await fetch(`/api/applications/apply/${currentJob.id}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  credentials: 'include' // HTTPOnly cookies handled automatically
});
```

### 2. Profile API (`src/features/profile/api/profileApi.new.ts`)
- **Removed localStorage token logic**: No longer reads `authToken` from localStorage
- **Removed Authorization header**: No longer adds Bearer token to requests
- **Added `credentials: 'include'`**: Ensures HTTPOnly cookies are included in API calls

```typescript
// Before: Manual token management
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
if (token) {
  config.headers = {
    ...config.headers,
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  };
}

// After: Automatic cookie handling
credentials: 'include', // HTTPOnly cookies handled by browser
```

### 3. Authentication Debug Utility (`src/utils/authDebug.ts`)
- **Updated debug information**: Removed references to localStorage tokens
- **Added HTTPOnly cookie information**: Explains why auth cookies aren't visible to JavaScript
- **Improved security messaging**: Clarifies that invisible cookies are actually more secure

```typescript
// Before: Token-based debug info
const authState = {
  hasToken: !!authToken,
  tokenValue: authToken ? `${authToken.substring(0, 10)}...` : null,
  // ...
};

// After: Cookie-based debug info
const authState = {
  hasVisibleCookies: cookies.length > 0,
  httpOnlyCookieNote: 'HTTPOnly authentication cookies are not visible to JavaScript (this is secure)',
  // ...
};
```

## Existing HTTPOnly Cookie Infrastructure

The following components were already properly configured for HTTPOnly cookies:

### AuthContext (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Already configured for HTTPOnly cookie authentication
- ✅ Optimistic authentication state management
- ✅ Proper logout handling with backend coordination

### Auth API Service (`src/services/auth.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses axios with `withCredentials: true`
- ✅ Proper logout endpoint integration
- ✅ Cookie cleanup utilities

### Base API Service (`src/services/api.tsx`)
- ✅ Configured with `withCredentials: true`
- ✅ Automatic cookie inclusion in all requests

## Security Benefits

1. **XSS Protection**: HTTPOnly cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript, preventing token theft via XSS attacks
2. **Automatic Management**: Browser handles cookie sending/receiving automatically
3. **Secure Transmission**: Cookies can be marked as Secure (HTTPS only) and SameSite
4. **Server-Side Control**: Backend has full control over cookie expiration and invalidation

## Backend Requirements

The backend must be configured to:
1. Set HTTPOnly cookies for JWT tokens
2. Handle `credentials: include` requests properly
3. Configure CORS to allow credentials from frontend domain
4. Implement proper cookie security attributes (Secure, SameSite, etc.)

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All authentication-related localStorage references removed
- ✅ All API calls include `credentials: 'include'`
- ✅ Debug utilities updated for HTTPOnly cookies
- ✅ Existing HTTPOnly infrastructure maintained

## Migration Notes

This update removes all client-side token storage and management. The application now relies entirely on HTTPOnly cookies for authentication, which is more secure but requires backend coordination for authentication state management.
